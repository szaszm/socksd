# socksd
An unstable partial SOCKS proxy server implementation, done as a university homework in 2015. Supports IPv4 and IPv6, but only unauthenticated TCP connections.

The docs and the help is in Hungarian, the rest is in English. There are probably memory errors in the code, you should absolutely not use it in production.

Just publishing it, because I found it interesting to see how I wrote when I was 19. It's not as terrible as I expected. :)
